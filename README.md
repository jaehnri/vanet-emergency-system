# About

This project is a Veins framework based emergency system. It is part of a the software system group in IME-USP

# Dependencies

The veins project has two depencies: Omnet++ and SUMO.
This project has a docker image in order to speed up its development. Its dockerfile is in /docker and you can download it via https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/brunopec/veins/general

It's expected Veins v4.7.1, omnet++ v5.6.2 and SUMO v1.8.0.

# Executing

The SUMO Traffic Control Interface (TraCI) modules for OMNeT++ come with a small daemon to make running coupled simulations easier - the `veins_launchd` script under the `bin` folder.

Make sure to execute it from the root folder:

```bash
./bin/veins_launchd -vv -c sumo
```

Notice that this assumes you can execute `sumo` from anywhere. If this is not the case, check your `SUMO_HOME` variable and replace accordingly, example:

```bash
$ echo $SUMO_HOME
/usr/local/bin/sumo

$ ./bin/veins_launchd -vv -c /usr/local/bin/sumo
```
